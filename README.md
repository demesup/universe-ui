## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Getting started

### Prerequisites

#### Install nodejs

1. Check if you already have Node.js installed. Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
```

If node is not installed on your machine, you can go to the official nodejs.org website, and choose the version depending on your operating system:

- <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/" target="_blank">Install node.js and npm on Windows, Linux or Mac OSX</a>

2. Enable pnpm with corepack

```bash
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

> _corepack is installed with node from **v16.13.x**, if your version is below, install it with: `npm install -g corepack`_

To setup the template and start installing project dependencies, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm install
```

Note that you can also use other package manager (npm or yarn) but we recommend using pnpm:

```bash
# using npm
npm install

# using yarn
yarn install
```

## üîÉ Run a development server

To start the development server, run one of the following commands:

```bash
# using pnpm (recommended)
pnpm dev
```

Using npm or yarn

```bash
# using npm
npm run dev

# using yarn
yarn dev
```
